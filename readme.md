# Accessible navbar demo

This little demo shows how to make an accessible navbar according to RGAAA rules.

The navbar is also responsive.

This is based on the [Stephanie Eckles' excellent work on the subject](https://moderncss.dev/css-only-accessible-dropdown-navigation-menu/), many thanks to her.

You can see the compiled demo at https://accessible-navbar.surge.sh/

To run this locally, I recommand to use VSCode with the following extensions
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server)
- [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)

You will notice the javascript used to control the aria-expanded values of submenus' button.
